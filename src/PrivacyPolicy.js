      <h2>Facebook Authentication</h2>
      <p>We offer you the option to sign up and log in to our service using Facebook Authentication. This service is
        provided by Facebook Inc. to offer a convenient alternative to traditional login methods. When you choose to log
        in with Facebook, you authorize us to access and use certain information from your Facebook profile. This
        includes your name, email address, and any other information you choose to share according to your Facebook
        account settings. We use this information to create and manage your account with us and to provide a
        personalized and enhanced user experience. Please note that we do not receive or store your Facebook password at
        any time.
      </p>
      <h2>Data Collection and Processing for Marketing Campaigns</h2>
      <p>Our service analyzes data related to marketing campaigns to provide insights and improve marketing strategies.
        To achieve this, we may collect data from various sources, including public marketing campaign information. We
        process this data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze trends, sentiments, and
        effectiveness. The insights gained from this analysis help us and our users to make informed decisions about
        marketing strategies and optimize campaign performance.
      </p>
      <h2>Data Storage Policy</h2>
      <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy and the integrity of your data. In line with this commitment, we do
        not store any personal data collected during the authentication process or the data used in our NLP analysis of
        marketing campaigns. All processing of marketing campaign data is performed in real-time, and the data is not
        retained after the analysis is complete. We ensure that our data processing activities are conducted in
        accordance with the highest standards of privacy and data protection.
      </p>
      <h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>
      <p>You have control over the information you provide to us through Facebook Authentication. You can manage your
        privacy settings within your Facebook account to control the information that is shared with us and other
        third-party services. Additionally, you have the right to inquire about the data we process about you and to
        request the deletion of your account and associated data from our service.
      </p>
